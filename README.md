# my_Books
Create and manage your favorite book selection.
This project is an extension of the “Flask SQLAlchemy tutorial” by Shajia Abidi on  building a Flask app that keeps track of your book collection.
The main idea behind my_Books was to extend the original app capabilities by making it perform as the likes of a single page web application with a UI that lets the user interact with the book selection dynamically, so that all CRUD operations could be integrated without leaving the app’s main page.
Furthermore, rethinking the front-end appearance and adding an API endpoint to get information about the book selection were among the ideas to improve  the overall design experience.

# my_Books
Create and manage your favorite book collection.

This project is an extension of the “Flask SQLAlchemy tutorial” by Shajia Abidi on  building a Flask app that keeps track of your book collection.

The main idea behind my_Books was to extend the app's original capabilities by making it perform as the likes of a single page web application with an UI that lets the user interact with the book selection dynamically, so that all CRUD operations could be integrated without leaving the app’s main page.

Furthermore, rethinking about the front-end appearance and adding an API endpoint to get information about the book selection were among the complementary ideas to improve the overall design experience.
